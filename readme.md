# Chess engine in Go
An attempt at building a small chess engine capable of beating myself.

Using [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/), [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/) for front-end interactivity.
[notnil/chess](https://github.com/notnil/chess) for generating valid moves and the chess engine itself is served via a [gin](https://gin-gonic.com) webserver.
